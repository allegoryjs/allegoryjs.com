# Beyond Branching and Scripting: The Philosophy of Allegory.js

## The State of Affairs
If you want to make an Interactive Fiction (IF) game, you have
your pick of some really powerful and well-established tools, as well as some very cool
newer choices. The main tools in this space these days are [Twine](https://twinery.org/),
[Inform 7](https://ganelson.github.io/inform-website/), and [Ink](https://www.inklestudios.com/ink/)
("_the big three_").
Some other options are [Ren'Py](https://www.renpy.org/),
[ChoiceScript](https://www.choiceofgames.com/make-your-own-games/choicescript-intro/),
[Adventuron](https://adventuron.io/), and [Narrat](https://narrat.dev/).
**These tools are all amazing.** Go check them out, seriously.
The big three have huge communities, lots of resources, and they're all free to use.

Twine is unmatched for Choose Your Own Adventure (CYOA) games,
which typically lean heavily into the narrative side of things; you end up with branching
paths of hyperlinked webpages constituting your game. These are perfectly suited to
the style of adventure where the player/reader is presented with some choices
(_do you want to take the left or right door?_) and each one takes you down a set path.
Think, the old Goosebumps books, where you skip to page 46 if you choose left, and 73 if
you choose to go right, but way more powerful and well-suited for nonlinear narratives.
However, for games where you need to track state and have reactive
systems (e.g. you can pick up a key in the beginning of the game, and that
stays in your inventory until the end of the game, where if you have the key, you can
unlock a secret door; or you pick up an apple, and over time, it rots if you don't eat it),
you run into some of the limitations of the engine. You **have to rely on macros which
aren't the prettiest or most intuitive to use**, and you can end up with **a lot of if-else
checks for logic** all over the place.

Inform 7 is a masterclass in developer experience and game world simulation. The plain English-like
programming language you use to create games in Inform is frankly astonishing. You write
code like "A car is a type of thing. A car has four doors. A door can be open or closed,"
and so on, to build the rules of your game universe. The compiler takes care of the data
and simulation based on this expressive code, and as the player you can walk around,
pick things up, open and close doors and containers--all sorts of things that make the
game feel richly detailed. However, it has a few usability issues. The game developer
needs to think of all synonyms and ways of expressing ideas, and if they miss something,
you can end up in a situation where the engine doesn't understand it if you type
"attack the goblin with the sword," and the player needs to figure out the special keywords,
which might be something like "use sword on goblin". **This can break immersion and frustrate the player**,
and create a bit of a **learning curve for players**. Also, the engine generates images that
run in a VM; there are implementations of the VM for the web, but **in terms of accessibility
and styling, you have very few options**. You are locked in to a Zork-style text adventure
that some people (such as vision-impaired individuals) don't get to enjoy.

Ink is a really cool tool that excels at narrative branching and dialogue scripting. It
is made as a sort of middleware that allows game devs to write their games' flows in a
way that reads like a screenplay. It plugs into game engines like Unity to enable all
sorts of audio-visual accompaniments and great console exportability. However, Ink itself
**does not provide a way to author game logic**. If you want an inventory system, you have to
write it in the "host" game engine itself. It's perfect for defining text flows,
but **isn't "batteries included"** when it comes to other types of functionality.

There are lots of other awesome tools and engines in the IF space, and they each
bring unique strengths to the table. They are all absolutely worth looking into,
and one of them may be the perfect tool for making your game. So where does Allegory.js
fit in?

## An Engine for the Modern Web
> Allegory.js is a web-native IF game engine with NLP capabilities and an ergonomic API


Allegory.js humbly builds on ideas of the titans which came before it, and it also
has a few new tricks up its sleeve. Allegory.js aims to:
- enable players to declare what they want to do (or even ask if they can do it), without memorizing special keywords and syntax, e.g.

> "can I break that window with the rock?"

> "slash at that goblin"

> "talk to the guy with the hat"
- provide a fluent API that gets out of the game developer's way
    ```javascript
    ThereIsAContainer('old_chest')
        .containing('rusty_key')
        .onIntent('OPEN', () => Success("It creaks open."));
    ```
- enable a quick development cycle out of the box for most people, while also giving the relentlessly "think-outside-the-box" 1% of game devs the tools to do whatever they can dream up
- empower game devs to create a wide variety of games, from systems-light CYOA to hardcore simulation
- put the full breadth of the JS/TS ecosystem at IF game devs' disposal
- give all types of players access to games by baking in support for web accessibility tools and internationalization
- make use of emerging machine learning techniques to make development faster while leaving the creative vision solely in the hands of the developer
- ship in a tiny, efficient package that can run just as well on low-end phones as powerful desktops
- be able to do everything locally in the player's browser without necessarily needing to pay/wait for API calls

The vision is a game engine that devs of all skill levels and creative inclinations will love to use.

## What's Next?
This is the first installment of the Allegory.js blog. In future posts, we'll mostly be discussing
architectural decisions and topics we've explored in the process of making this engine.
Always feel free to leave thoughts in the [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/allegoryjs/allegoryjs/discussions). Allegory.js is still in its infancy,
and you are invited to follow along as it grows.

Until next time, thanks for stopping by, and take care!
